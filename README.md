Edit and Delete Functionality: Users have the ability to edit campaign details and associated UTM tags, as well as delete campaigns when necessary.

Click Tracking: The application tracks the number of clicks on each UTM-tagged URL, providing valuable insights into the performance of marketing campaigns.

User Authentication: Secure user authentication system ensures that only authorized users can access and modify campaign data.

Create Campaign: Users start by creating a new marketing campaign, providing details such as campaign name, start and end dates, and target audience.

Add UTM Tags: Within each campaign, users can add multiple UTM-tagged URLs, specifying parameters like source, medium, content, and term.

Track Performance: As users share the UTM-tagged URLs across various marketing channels, the application tracks the number of clicks for each link, allowing users to monitor campaign performance in real-time.
